# Save the Battery
Take care of your Linux laptop battery by not letting it over-charge.   

This repo contains a small script called set_charge_levels.sh which is used to set the maximum charge levels of your battery to a given percentage of charge.  The script also allows for the minimum battery level before a charge can accepted. 

Together, this allows your battery to be kept between a min and max levels.

Combined with adding this to rc.local, your battery is assured of never being charged behyond a given value.
